# Responsive-Portfolio

#### Fabian Flores

## Description
For this week's homework assignment, I used w3c's responsive design recommendations. As suggested, I started with
the mobile responsive design. In general, I went from small to larger, beginning with the 640px and slowly advancing toward the 980px design.

I leveraged the use of rows, column width layouts, in order to simplify transitions from one grid design to another. The customized column width layouts for each media query represent a similiar idea to bootstrap's framework.

I incorporated sass into my web design workflow.
